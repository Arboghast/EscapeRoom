For some reason, our final product seems to be on the 'Backend' branch, so go there (1).
(2) add the contents of '/jar/gg/lib' to GeneralProject's build path
(3) Run the main.java file located at '/GeneralProject/src/mygame/Main.java'

ps: a lot of the functionality of the game has been broken since I last opened this project ~ 14 months ago, it is just a room with objects now...do as you please.
